# 056 INCH 3 DIGIT 7 SEGMENT SERIALLY CONTROLED LED DISPLAY 

Open source 7 segment serially controlled led display that fits inside a generic 45x26mm panel mount plastic enclosure. Based on [TM1637](assets/pdf/TM1637.pdf) chip. This IC is controlled by a serial two wire bus similar, but not exactly to i2c.

The display can be now controlled by Arduino (or any other) boards via serial bus, using a library written for led display modules based on TM1637 chip.
